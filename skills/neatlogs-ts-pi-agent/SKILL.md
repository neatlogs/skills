# Neatlogs TypeScript Setup — Pi Agent

This project uses **Pi Agent** (maintained as `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`). Neatlogs instruments it with **`piAgentHooks()` from `neatlogs/pi-agent`**. The wrapper also supports legacy `@mariozechner` releases through the same event interface.

## Core mechanism — `piAgentHooks(agent)`

`Agent` exposes `subscribe(listener)` and emits lifecycle events (`agent_*`, `turn_*`, `message_*`, `tool_execution_*`). Neatlogs translates them into spans. For maintained `AgentHarness`, it additionally wraps model-producing `compact()` and summarizing `navigateTree()` operations because those calls occur outside the Agent event loop. There is no import-order rule.

One `agent.prompt()` = **one trace**:

```
AGENT  pi_agent.run                  (agent_start → agent_end)
 ├─ CHAIN pi_agent.turn.1            (turn_start → turn_end)
 │   ├─ LLM  pi_agent.llm.<model>    (message_start → message_end = real provider latency)
 │   └─ TOOL pi_agent.tool.<name>    (tool_execution_start → tool_execution_end)
 └─ CHAIN pi_agent.turn.2            (the post-tool-result turn)
     └─ LLM  pi_agent.llm.<model>
```

| Span | Carries |
|------|---------|
| **AGENT** | run input (first user message), final output, `neatlogs.agent.stop_reason` + `neatlogs.error.message` on an aborted/errored run |
| **CHAIN** | `neatlogs.chain.turn_index`, the message that prompted the turn, the turn's assistant text (or the tool calls it made), `neatlogs.chain.tool_result_count` |
| **LLM** | model / `response_model` / provider / api, input messages, output + `tool_calls.*`, token counts (incl. cache read/write), **exact `cost_usd` from pi-ai's own pricing**, `metrics.ttft_ms`, `is_streaming`, `stop_reason` |
| **TOOL** | tool name, `call_id`, input args, result, `is_error`, `is_streaming` for tools that emit partial updates |

## Steps

1. [Install and check the Pi version](references/1-install.md)
2. [Add `init()` and `piAgentHooks()`](references/2-init-and-wrap.md)
3. [Set environment variables](references/3-set-env.md)
4. [Verify every Agent or harness](references/4-verify.md)
5. [Handle lifecycle and flushing](references/5-lifecycle.md)

## Rules (apply to ALL steps)

- `piAgentHooks` patches the **instance** you pass (it subscribes to it), NOT the module — so **plain static imports are fine**. There is no "init before import" rule for Pi Agent, unlike provider-SDK wrappers.
- USE the wrapped reference. `piAgentHooks` subscribes in place AND returns the agent, so `const agent = piAgentHooks(new Agent({...}))` then call `agent.prompt(...)`.
- Call it on **every** `Agent` instance you want traced. Wrapping is **idempotent** — calling it twice on the same instance is a no-op, so it never double-traces.
- NEVER pass `instrumentations: [...]`. `piAgentHooks` is the sole capture point for Pi-routed model calls; `init()` rejects provider keys.
- Pi calls the model through its `pi-ai` package, not a bare provider SDK, so do **not** also wrap the provider (`wrapOpenAI`, `wrapAnthropic`, …) for Pi-routed calls. Only wrap a provider client the app calls **directly** outside Pi.
- Cost is **not** re-derived from tokens: pi-ai prices each call against its own model registry and neatlogs carries that exact figure through as `neatlogs.llm.cost_usd`.
- Do NOT manually wrap `agent.prompt()` in `span()`/`trace()` on top of `piAgentHooks` — that double-traces. Nesting a wrapped agent INSIDE your own `span()` is fine and correct: the AGENT span parents to it.
- All lifecycle calls are async: `await init()`, `await flush()`, `await shutdown()`.
- Never hardcode API keys — use `process.env`.
- For managed Neatlogs, omit `endpoint`, `baseUrl`, and `NEATLOGS_ENDPOINT`; the SDK already uses `https://ingest.neatlogs.com`.

## Live completion gate (wizard or standalone coding agent)

This skill does not grant platform access. Immediately before exercising the real path, record the current UTC timestamp. After the run, call the already-connected Neatlogs platform MCP's existing `get_trace_context(created_after=<UTC timestamp>)` directly to select the latest trace in the intended project; do not make preliminary MCP discovery calls. While its `status` is `processing` or `finalization_status` is `pending`, poll that same trace with `get_trace_context(trace_id=<trace_id>)`. Once finalized, page with `get_trace_context(trace_id=<trace_id>, offset=<next_offset>)` until `next_offset` is null, and verify that all `span_count` spans were inspected. If MCP is unavailable, ask the user to configure `https://ingest.neatlogs.com/mcp` with the project key stored as a client secret; never print or request the key in chat, and leave verification incomplete.

- Print concise user-visible progress before and after install, code changes, build, restart, runtime verification, and platform confirmation. Never print secrets.
- Run the project's existing build/typecheck/test commands with its detected package manager. Source inspection alone is not verification.
- For servers and startup hooks, build and start a fresh process after instrumentation changes, then exercise the actual instrumented route/action/entry point.
- Run a safe bounded verification through the real instrumented entry point. Inspect the full persisted span tree and attributes, not only a trace-list summary or local debug output. Confirm the latest project trace is the fresh run, with one canonical span per operation and no duplicate LLM/tool/agent spans. An offline/no-export verifier is insufficient by itself.
- Do not claim completion until all applicable checks pass. If runtime or ingestion cannot be confirmed, report the exact blocker and leave the result incomplete.
