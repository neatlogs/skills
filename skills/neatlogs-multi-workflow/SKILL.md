# NeatLogs — Multiple Workflows in One Codebase

Most real services do more than one thing: a chat copilot, a summarizer, a report generator, a background evaluation job. Each is an **independent workflow** — its own inputs, its own shape, its own success criteria — and you want them to appear in the NeatLogs dashboard as *separate*, filterable workflows, not one blob.

This skill is **language-agnostic**. Apply it alongside the language skill (`neatlogs-py`, `neatlogs-ts`, `neatlogs-go`) — those cover `init()` and span APIs; this covers how to split one codebase into N workflows.

For managed Neatlogs, do not add an endpoint/base URL option or `NEATLOGS_ENDPOINT`; every SDK defaults to `https://ingest.neatlogs.com`.

## Completion gate

Before running a build, test, restart, or workflow, show every command and
obtain explicit user approval. Run the approved project checks, restart the
process that loads the changed boundaries, and exercise each changed workflow
entry point with safe representative input.

Through the target project's normal product trace view or supported public read
path, verify the exact finalized trace for each run. Every workflow must have
one meaningful root, its intended top-level workflow label and hierarchy, and
no duplicate operation spans. Do not use a legacy marker-discovery protocol or
infer success from installation, local logs, exporter flush, or HTTP
acceptance. Keep credentials out of commands, output, files, and agent context.
If any exact trace cannot be inspected, report that workflow's blocker and
leave it incomplete.

## Core rule

**`init()` is process-wide and single-shot.** Its `workflow_name` is ONE label for the whole process; calling `init()` again with a different name is a no-op. So you do **not** create multiple workflows by calling `init()` multiple times in one process.

To get N workflows from one codebase, **declare each workflow at its entry point** — the place where that feature's call first starts (the request handler, the job function, the queue-consumer callback) — by opening a named `WORKFLOW` root there, and **overriding the workflow label** on that root.

---

## The two levels

A large service uses both:

1. **Separate process / boot path → separate `init()`.** Two things that boot independently (an HTTP server + a standalone worker; a main app + a mounted sub-app) each call `init()` with their own `workflow_name`. This works *because* they are separate boot paths.
2. **One process, many features → one `init()`, a named root per feature.** The common case. Inside a single process, each feature opens its own `WORKFLOW` root where its work starts. This skill focuses here.

---

## Name vs. workflow — two different dashboard dimensions

| Dimension | What it is | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| **Root span name** | The **title** of an individual trace | The `name` passed when opening the root |
| **Workflow** | The **group** a trace belongs to (dashboard Workflow column / filter / analytics) | Process default from `init(workflow_name=...)` / `init({ workflowName })`; canonical per-root override `neatlogs.workflow.name` |

> ⚠️ **Naming the root span is NOT enough to make a distinct workflow.** The span name is the trace title; the Workflow dimension uses the process default unless the root sets canonical `neatlogs.workflow.name`. If a feature only opens a differently-*named* root but never sets that attribute, it still rolls up under the single `init()` workflow. Convention: use the same human-readable string for both the root name and the workflow override so the trace title and Workflow column agree.

---

## The pattern per language

Open the root at the FIRST line of the feature's work, and set the label there.

### Python

Set the canonical per-root `neatlogs.workflow.name` attribute with `set_attribute`:

```python
import neatlogs

neatlogs.init(api_key=..., workflow_name="my-service")  # process-wide default

@app.post("/copilot/chat")
async def copilot_chat(req):
    with neatlogs.trace("Copilot chat", kind="WORKFLOW") as root:
        root.set_attribute("neatlogs.workflow.name", "Copilot chat")
        return await run_copilot(req)
```

A helper keeps entry points to one call:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def workflow(name: str):
    with neatlogs.trace(name, kind="WORKFLOW") as root:
        root.set_attribute("neatlogs.workflow.name", name)
        yield root

with workflow("Report generation"):
    ...
```

### TypeScript

Set the per-root label via `attributes` (dot-form `neatlogs.workflow.name`):

```typescript
import { trace } from 'neatlogs';

await trace(
  { name: 'Copilot chat', kind: 'WORKFLOW', attributes: { 'neatlogs.workflow.name': 'Copilot chat' } },
  async () => runCopilot(req),
);
```

You can also `span.setAttribute('neatlogs.workflow.name', 'Copilot chat')` inside the callback. The process-global `neatlogs.workflow_name` from `init()` is not overwritten.

### Go

`Trace(ctx, name)` takes no options, so use `StartSpan` with the `neatlogs.workflow.name` attribute (or `SetAttributes` on the root):

```go
import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"

ctx, span, end := neatlogs.StartSpan(ctx, "Copilot chat", "workflow",
    attribute.String("neatlogs.workflow.name", "Copilot chat"))
defer end()
_ = span
```

`neatlogs.Trace(ctx, name)` is the shorthand when a named root is enough and you're happy for it to roll up under the `Init` workflow name.

---

## Choosing workflow boundaries

Treat each as its own workflow:

- **Distinct product features** — copilot, summarizer, autocomplete, report generator.
- **Distinct trigger types for the same logic** — synchronous API path vs. background/queue path, if you want them analyzed separately.
- **Distinct jobs in a worker** — each scheduled or event-driven job function.

Keep it **one workflow per feature area**, not per request and not per file. Use a stable, human-readable label. Environment/version → [tags](https://docs.neatlogs.com/sdk/tags); per-user/per-conversation → [sessions](https://docs.neatlogs.com/sdk/sessions) / [end-user identity](https://docs.neatlogs.com/sdk/end-user-identity) — none of these belong in the workflow name.

---

## Reference implementation

The NeatLogs AI service (one FastAPI process) is the canonical example:

- **One `init(workflow_name="AI Service")`** as the coarse process fallback.
- **Each feature opens its own `WORKFLOW` root at its handler and overrides the label** — adapt the names to the application's real features — via a shared helper that calls `span.set_attribute("neatlogs.workflow.name", <label>)` on the root plus tenant/session attributes. The backend prefers this per-root value over the process default for the trace's Workflow column.
- **A separately-booted sub-app runs its own `init(workflow_name="Neatlogs Harness")`** — level 1 (separate boot path → separate workflow).
- Features that only name the root but skip the override still roll up under `"AI Service"` — proof that the override, not the span name, carves out a distinct workflow.
